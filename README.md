# Local LLM Chat

A private, fully-local multimodal chat web app. It talks to a model running in
**LM Studio** (or any `llama.cpp` server exposing an OpenAI-compatible API) — no
data leaves your machine, no cloud API keys.

> Built with non-Chinese, open models. Recommended chat model is Google **Gemma 4 12B**
> (vision-capable; **Gemma 3 4B** for low VRAM); RAG embeddings use **nomic-embed-text**.

## Features

- 💬 **Streaming chat** with markdown + code rendering
- 🖼️ **Vision / image input** — drop an image and ask about it (multimodal)
- 📄 **RAG** — upload PDF / text / markdown, chat grounded in your documents with citations
- 🎙️ **Voice** — speech-to-text via Whisper (runs in your browser), text-to-speech via OS voices
- 🌐 **Grok search tool** — the local model can borrow Grok's X (Twitter) + web search via a `grok_search` tool and receive only Grok's synthesized answer (saves context)
- 🗂️ **Conversation history** — saved locally in SQLite

Everything runs on a single Next.js app + a local SQLite database. Speech-to-text
and text-to-speech run entirely client-side (no extra services).

> Note: the Whisper model (~150MB) is downloaded from the Hugging Face hub on the
> first voice recording, then cached in your browser. Transcription itself runs
> locally. TTS uses your OS voices (fully offline).

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| LLM transport | `openai` SDK → LM Studio / llama.cpp OpenAI-compatible API |
| Storage | SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (conversations + RAG vectors) |
| Speech-to-text | `@huggingface/transformers` (Whisper, WASM/WebGPU, in-browser) |
| Text-to-speech | Web Speech API (OS voices, offline) |

## Code-enforced SOP control layer

Small local models drift and hallucinate, so behavior is **enforced in code**, not
left to a system prompt. Every chat turn runs through a control pipeline
(`src/lib/sop/`):

1. **Intent gate** — a JSON-schema structured call returns `{restatement, ambiguous,
   clarifyingQuestion}`, validated by zod. If the request is ambiguous, code
   **short-circuits the turn** and returns a clarifying question; the answer is never
   generated.
2. **Generation** — streamed by default.
3. **Deterministic validators** — citation whitelist (fabricated `[n]` sources are
   stripped/flagged), disclaimer/flattery stripping, empty-response detection. Pure
   code, no model trust.
4. **Strict monitor (default on)** — the governing path. Generate → monitor
   (deterministic checks) → on failure, issue a **harsh internal scold-correction**
   that forces a fixed answer → **sanitize so the scolding never leaks to the user** →
   refuse if still non-compliant. **Concrete citations are mandatory** whenever sources
   exist (RAG/Grok): every `[n]` must map to a real source, fabricated ones are stripped,
   and an uncited answer is rejected. The user only ever sees the corrected answer plus a
   neutral control note — never the reprimand.
5. **Verify gate (opt-in, `SOP_VERIFY_GATE`)** — an extra LLM self-audit that can also
   trigger corrections. Off by default because a small model auditing itself is noisy;
   useful with a larger model.

Toggle via env (`SOP_INTENT_GATE`, `SOP_STRICT_MONITOR`, `SOP_BLOCKING`,
`SOP_VERIFY_GATE`). The system prompt states the rules, but the gates above are what
actually enforce them — in code, not on trust.

## Grok search tool (xAI)

The local model can call a `grok_search` function-tool that borrows Grok's
**server-side X (Twitter) + web search** (via xAI's Responses API
`POST /v1/responses` with `web_search` + `x_search` tools). Grok runs the whole
search→read→synthesize loop on its servers and returns one answer; the local
model receives **only that synthesized answer + sources**, not raw results — so
its context stays small.

Flow: local model emits a `grok_search` tool call → pipeline calls xAI →
Grok's answer is fed back as the tool result → local model writes the final
reply with `[n]` citations.

Enable it by setting `XAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` (get one at
<https://console.x.ai>), then toggle **Grok** in the chat header. The model is
configurable via `GROK_MODEL` (default `grok-build-0.1`). The legacy Live Search
`search_parameters` API is retired — this uses the current Agent Tools API.

### Cloud backend + xAI media

In Settings you can switch the **chat backend** from local to **Grok (cloud)**.
On the Grok backend the app uses xAI's native **Responses API** (`/v1/responses`):

- **X + web search** run server-side automatically (no toggle needed).
- **Image generation** (`generate_image` → Grok Imagine, `/v1/images/generations`)
  and **video generation** (`generate_video` → `grok-imagine-video-1.5-preview`,
  `/v1/videos/generations`, async) are client-side function tools — the model calls
  them and the result is shown inline.
- **Voice**: TTS via `/v1/tts` (natural voices) and STT via `/v1/stt` replace the
  browser engines when a key is present (falling back to browser TTS/Whisper otherwise).
- **Realtime voice agent**: the **Voice** button opens a speech-to-speech session
  over WebSocket (`wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime`) using an ephemeral token.

## Prerequisites

1. **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)** (or `llama.cpp` server).
2. In LM Studio, download and load:
   - A chat model — recommended **`google/gemma-4-12b`** (vision-capable, non-Chinese,
     best quality on ~8GB VRAM). For low VRAM / faster responses use
     **`google/gemma-3-4b`**. Use the exact key shown by `lms ls`.
   - An embedding model — recommended **`nomic-embed-text-v1.5`** (for RAG).
3. Start the **Local Server** in LM Studio (default `http://localhost:1234`).
4. Node.js 20+.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # adjust model names to match LM Studio
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

### Configuration

All settings come from environment variables (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | LM Studio server URL |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | `lm-studio` | any non-empty string |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `gemma-3-4b-it` | must match the loaded chat model |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5` | must match the loaded embedding model |
