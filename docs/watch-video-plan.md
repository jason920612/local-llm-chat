# Plan: `watch_video` — let the model watch video files and web videos

Status: **design finalized (owner-approved in chat); implementation pending**
Scope: one new tool `watch_video`, backed by the per-conversation microVM
sandbox. Author: design agreed with the project owner in chat.

## 1. Core constraint (why this shape)

The xAI API has **no native video-understanding input**. It supports:
- Image understanding — `input_image` (URL or base64; JPEG/PNG; ≤20MiB/image;
  no image-count limit). This is what grok-build-0.1 multimodal already uses.
- Video **generation** (Imagine API, async) — already wired as `generate_video`.

There is no endpoint to hand the model a video to "watch". So watching is
synthesized: **sample frames → feed as a sequence of images** (reusing the
existing vision-injection pipeline), plus **transcribe the audio track** (xAI
batch STT) and feed it as text. All media work runs in the conversation's
microVM; STT (needs the API key) runs host-side.

Refs: docs.x.ai model-capabilities/video (generation only),
model-capabilities/images/understanding (image input spec), `/v1/stt` batch
transcription (file → text, auto language).

## 2. Tool surface

**Single tool** `watch_video` (owner choice — one tool, not two):

```
watch_video({
  source: string,        // sandbox filename / uploaded file  OR  a URL
                         // (direct video file, YouTube, or a web page w/ a player)
  prompt?: string,       // optional focus, e.g. "what happens after the goal?"
  audio?: boolean,       // default true — also transcribe the audio track
})
```

Returns to the model: the sampled **frames as real images** (injected as
`input_image` into the next round, like `send_screenshot`), plus a text result
with **metadata** (duration, frames sampled, per-frame timestamps) and the
**audio transcript** (coarse timestamps). The huge base64 frame data is stripped
from the text result (same pattern as observe/action vision feedback).

Follow-up visual inspection is handled by `inspect_video_moments`, using the
`video_id` returned by `watch_video`:

```
inspect_video_moments({
  video_id: string,
  moments: [{ timeSec: number, reason?: string }],
  windowSec?: number,
  framesPerMoment?: number,
})
```

This lets the model read the full timestamped transcript first, choose which
moments need visual evidence, and then extract frames around only those moments
without downloading the same video again.

Gating: offered when `sandbox.driver === "microvm"`. The browser-fallback
acquisition path additionally requires `microvm.computer.enabled`; without it,
only the file / yt-dlp paths are used.

## 3. Pipeline (in the guest, one VM job)

`source` is auto-routed:

1. **Sandbox file / uploaded file** → use directly (resolve under `/workspace`).
2. **URL** → acquire, two paths, best-fidelity first:
   - **(a) yt-dlp download** (preferred): grab the video incl. audio, capped at
     **≤720p**. Works for YouTube and most mainstream sites; gives a clean file
     for offline frame + audio extraction.
   - **(b) browser-playback fallback** (any site, incl. stream-only players
     yt-dlp can't fetch): play in the existing computer-use Chromium under Xvfb
     and capture in real time — see §4. Used only when (a) fails.

Then, for the obtained file (paths a/1) or the live capture (path b):

### 3.1 Frame sampling — scene-change detection + duration-scaled budget

Owner choice: sample by **magnitude of visual change** (ffmpeg scene score),
not fixed/even spacing, with a budget that **scales with length** so long videos
aren't under-sampled, and a hard ceiling for cost.

- ffmpeg computes a scene score (0–1) per frame; candidates are frames whose
  score `> threshold` (default **0.3**).
- **Budget** = `clamp(ceil(minutes × 6), 8, 120)` frames.
  - e.g. 1m→8 (floor), 5m→30, 10m→60, ≥20m→120 (ceiling).
- **candidates > budget** → keep the `budget` highest-scoring frames.
- **candidates < budget** → add evenly-spaced fill frames up to a sensible
  coverage floor (so a static long video still gets frames), never exceeding
  budget.
- The **first frame is always included**.
- Frames downscaled to **long edge 768px**, JPEG — far under the 20MiB cap.

### 3.2 Audio → transcript (owner choice: frames + transcript)

- ffmpeg extracts the audio track to a file in `/workspace`.
- Host reads it (virtiofs share) and transcribes via xAI **batch STT**
  (`/v1/stt`, auto language). The audio is split into ~60s chunks so long
  videos can be transcribed in parallel. When xAI returns word-level timestamps,
  the host shifts each word by its chunk start time and groups words into
  sentence-level ranges like `[03:12.40-03:18.92] ...`, so the model can answer
  when a spoken line appeared in the video. If word timestamps are unavailable,
  the host falls back to chunk-level timestamps.

## 4. Browser-playback fallback with system-audio capture (§ owner-approved)

The microVM has no sound hardware, but audio capture needs none:

- Bake **PulseAudio** into base.img; on session start create a **null sink**
  (virtual speaker) as the default output; point Chromium at it.
- To watch: load the page → start recording the sink's **`.monitor`** source
  with ffmpeg → play the `<video>` → simultaneously capture frames and audio →
  stop when playback ends. This yields **clean, in-sync system audio** for ANY
  site (fixing the earlier "fallback has no audio" gap).
- **2× playback** (`video.playbackRate = 2`) to halve real-time capture; the
  sped audio is transcribed by STT afterward.
- **Cap ~15 min** of (sped) capture; anything beyond is not recorded and noted
  in the result.
- Playback end detected via `eval` on `<video>.ended` / `duration`; a max-time
  guard backstops it.

## 5. Long videos (owner choice)

No special limit / no chunked-watch for v1: rely on the **frame ceiling (120)**
plus the **full transcript** — watch the whole thing. (Cost is bounded by frame
count, not duration.) Auto-segmented watching can be added later if needed.

## 6. Defaults (all configurable via `config.ts`)

| Knob | Default |
|---|---|
| frames/min | 6 |
| frame floor / ceiling | 8 / 120 |
| scene threshold | 0.3 |
| frame long edge | 768px |
| audio transcript | on |
| yt-dlp max quality | ≤720p |
| browser playback rate | 2× |
| browser capture cap | ~15 min |
| STT chunk size | ~60s |

## 7. Files to change

- **`sandbox-host/build/stage3g-video.sh`** (new) — bake `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp`,
  `pulseaudio` into base.img; install null-sink autostart for the X session.
- **`sandbox-host/guest/llm-runner.py`** — new `watch_video` job: source
  routing, yt-dlp download, browser-playback capture (Pulse monitor + frames),
  scene-detect frame extraction with budget, audio extraction; returns frame
  file paths + audio file path + metadata.
- **`sandbox-host/build/stage3e-browser.sh`** (or session launcher) — start
  PulseAudio + create null sink in the computer-use session; Chromium → Pulse.
- **`src/lib/grok/stt.ts`** (new) — `transcribeAudioFile()` host helper (chunked,
  coarse timestamps); `/api/stt/route.ts` refactored to reuse it.
- **`src/lib/sandbox/driver.ts`** — `watchVideo()` interface + `WatchVideoResult`
  / `WatchVideoFrame` types.
- **`src/lib/sandbox/microvm.ts`** — `watchVideo()` impl (one VM job; longer
  timeout for download/real-time capture).
- **`src/lib/sandbox/local.ts`** (if present) — stub/unsupported.
- **`src/lib/config.ts`** — `microvm.video` knobs (table above).
- **`src/lib/grok/responses.ts`** — `WATCH_VIDEO_TOOL` schema; add to `toolset()`;
  dispatch: call `watchVideo`, push each frame via `pushVision`, run host STT on
  the returned audio file, assemble transcript + metadata as the text result.

## 8. Deploy

Code-only parts ship via `next build` + restart. The base.img parts
(`ffmpeg`/`yt-dlp`/`pulseaudio` + null-sink autostart) require stopping VMs and
`update-guest-runner.sh` / a base.img rebuild stage — done as a discrete step
with no VM in flight.

## 9. Test plan

- Direct file: upload a short clip → `watch_video(file)` → frames + transcript
  returned; model answers a content question.
- yt-dlp: a YouTube URL → ≤720p download → frames + audio transcript.
- Browser fallback: a stream-only player → Pulse-monitor audio + frames at 2×,
  ≤15min cap respected.
- Scene budget: verify 5m→~30, long static video still gets fill frames, busy
  video caps at 120 by top scene score.
